Nicolas Cage,"My father once said, 'If you're in the desert and you're dying of thirst, are you going to drink a glass of blood or are you going to drink a glass of water?'

Nyjah Huston,Everyone deserves to have clean water.
Christopher Hitchens,"Well look, I mean, I think that prayer and holy water, and things like that are all fine. They don't do any good, but they don't necessarily do any harm. It's touching to be thought of in that way. It makes up for those who tell me that I've got my just desserts."
Molly Ivins,"You look at the large problems that we face - that would be overpopulation, water shortages, global warming and AIDS, I suppose - all of that needs international cooperation to be solved."
Audrey Hepburn,"People in Ethiopia, the Sudan, etc., don't know Audrey Hepburn, but they recognize the name UNICEF. When they see UNICEF, their faces light up, because they know that something is happening. In the Sudan, for example, they call a water pump 'UNICEF.'"
Thomas Becket,"Many are needed to plant and water what has been planted now that the faith has spread so far and there are so many people... No matter who plants or waters, God gives no harvest unless what is planted is the faith of Peter and unless he agrees to his teachings."
Yuval Noah Harari,"Our bodies and minds evolved and were adapted for hundreds of thousands of years for tasks like climbing a tree and picking apples, or hunting rabbits, or looking for mushrooms in the forest. They were not adapted to the very gruelling work that is involved in field work - ploughing, harvesting, bringing water, digging weeds - things like that."
Gore Vidal,"To preserve the human race, it is now necessary to reorganize society. To this end, an Authority must be created with the power to control human population, to redistribute food, to purify air, water, soil, to re-pattern the cities."
Ofra Strauss,"Strauss' water activities, which highlight both its social responsibility and commitment to the environment, meet a genuine need of people around the world today."

Kobe Bryant,We all know what flopping is when we see it. The stuff that you see is where guys aren't really getting hit at all and are just flailing around like a fish out of water.
Klaus Kinski,"The truth is, I can never die. For I will be in everything and see you in everything and watch over you. I am your reaction in the water of a mountain lake."

Isaac Hayes,Have you ever wondered why young people take to music like fish to water? Maybe it's because music is fun. Plan and simple. It opens up their minds to dream great dreams about where they can go and what they can do when they get older.
Saint Teresa of Avila,"When the soul, through its own fault... becomes rooted in a pool of pitch-black, evil smelling water, it produces nothing but misery and filth."
Leonardo da Vinci,"In order to arrive at knowledge of the motions of birds in the air, it is first necessary to acquire knowledge of the winds, which we will prove by the motions of water in itself, and this knowledge will be a step enabling us to arrive at the knowledge of beings that fly between the air and the wind."
Tom Daley,"I'm partial to the Cornish coast, as it's near where I grew up in Plymouth. The views across the water are stunning. I love walking along the sandy beaches and the seafront paths."
Wilbur Smith,"They say if you drink Zambezi water with your mother's milk, you are always a slave of Africa, and I am."
Kelly Clarkson,"My friends and family are my support system. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times. Without them I have no idea where I would be and I know that their love for me is what's keeping my head above the water."
Jerry Saltz,"Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art."

Charles Maurice de Talleyrand,She is such a good friend that she would throw all her acquaintances into the water for the pleasure of fishing them out again.

Jurgen Klopp,People should not make me out to be like Jesus; I don't walk on water.
Kate Chopin,There are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the imprint of an oar upon the water.

Du Fu,"My heart is in a world of water and crystal, My clothes are damp in this time of spring rains."
Unknown,Women are like teabags. We don't know our true strength until we are in hot water!
Erin Brockovich,Saying drinking water is 'safe' without any supporting documentation is wrong. Resting on the comfort that the DHEC and the USEPA are there to give you cover is the same mistake the City of Flint made.
Tori Amos,"I have never smoked and have always drunk a lot of water, but cleanse, tone and moisturise every day? No way!"
Michael Phelps,I've been able to get an excitement back in the water.
Wangari Maathai,"I know there is pain when sawmills close and people lose jobs, but we have to make a choice. We need water and we need these forests."
Jamais Cascio,"Human civilization has been changing the Earth's environment for millennia, often to our detriment. Dams, deforestation and urbanization can alter water cycles and wind patterns, occasionally triggering droughts or even creating deserts."
Johan Rockstrom,"Emissions of greenhouse gases warm the planet, altering the carbon and water cycles. A warmer ocean stores more heat, providing more fuel for hurricanes. A warmer atmosphere holds more water, bringing dangerous deluges. Rising sea levels threaten coastal zones."
Alison Gopnik,"Asking questions is what brains were born to do, at least when we were young children. For young children, quite literally, seeking explanations is as deeply rooted a drive as seeking food or water."

Sulli,I have never bought a swim suit because of my fear for water.
Johan Rockstrom,"During the Holocene, we undoubtedly altered our environment significantly, clearing land, diverting water and building great cities."
Peter Thiel,"Seventy percent of the planet is covered with water, and there's so much we can be doing with oceans, and it was one of the frontiers that people have more or less abandoned."
Tom Perez,"Budgets are moral documents. They reflect the values of any government and when you're compromising clean air, clean water, and lead, you're making a statement about communities you don't care about."
Cyril Connolly,"Like water, we are truest to our nature in repose."

Ryan North,"Squirrel Girl is basically a Silver Age character in the modern age, and that makes her a fish out of water in a lot of ways. She likes being a superhero. She likes fighting crime. She doesn't sit around brooding in the darkness of her Squirrel Hole trying to figure out new ways to make crime pay."
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,"In rain water, I observed a small red worm and two other kinds of very minute insects; of those of the larger size, I judged that 30,000 together would not equal a coarse sand."

James Lind,"Into this pour the purified juice: and put it into a pan of water come almost to a boil and continue nearly in the state of boiling until the juice is found to be the consistency of a thick syrup when cold. It is then when cold, to be corked up in a bottle for use."
Michael Phelps,There are too many kids who are drowning for lack of water safety. That's something I'd like to do. Teaching kids to live an active lifestyle.
Takashi Murakami,"My parents came from the Kyushu Island in the Southern part of Japan to find work in Tokyo. So we could only afford to live downtown, in a low-income area. It was just by the river, and whenever a typhoon came around, we were under water up to, like, here. That's the kind of place we lived in."
Engelbert Humperdinck,"I drink a lot of water and a lot of wine. I'm a wine drinker. Red wine, preferably."

Esther Williams,"Somehow I kept my head above water. I relied on the discipline, character, and strength that I had started to develop as that little girl in her first swimming pool."
PartyNextDoor,"I'll take a shot of vodka if I want it to be raspy... I tell whoever's in the studio to get boiling hot water, like super boiling, that they're afraid to give it to me. I put it exactly on the back of my tongue to shock my body. That cleans it up."
George Washington Cable,"There came to port last Sunday night the queerest little craft, without an inch of rigging on; I looked and looked - and laughed. It seemed so curious that she should cross the unknown water, and moor herself within my room - my daughter! O my daughter!"
Zac Brown,"I have seen a lot of people, including myself, make a lot of tip money because of 'Black Water,' so this is a full circle moment. To collaborate and recreate this iconic song is just an amazing moment as an artist."
Ashlan Gorse Cousteau,"Forget bottled water; tap water is just as good! Pour it into a reusable water bottle, and always have fresh water on the go without wasting plastic."
Dolores Huerta,The conditions were terrible. The farmworkers were only earning about 70 cents an hour at that time - 90 cents was the highest wage that they were earning. They didn't have toilets in the fields; they didn't have cold drinking water. They didn't have rest periods. People worked from sunup to sundown. It was really atrocious.

Anne Hathaway,I used to believe that love was finding someone who would lead you through the deep water.
Paul Simon,I think Bridge Over Troubled Water was a very good song. Artie sang it beautifully. The Boxer was a really nice record. But I don't think I've written any great songs.
Diane von Furstenberg,"The most important thing is to be healthy, to drink a lot of water, to fight gravity as much as possible. I am one of the few people who decided I wasn't going to do any invasion with my face."

Art Buchwald,The powder is mixed with water and tastes exactly like powder mixed with water.

Catherine of Siena,"As the hart desires the spring of living water, so my soul desires to leave the prison of this dark body and see You in truth."
Sandra Tsing Loh,"The literature of menopause is the saddest, the most awful, and the most medical of all genres. You're sleepless, you're anxious, you're fat, you're depressed - and the advice is always the same: take more walks, eat some kale, and drink lots of water. It didn't help."
Gilbert Newton Lewis,"We frequently define an acid or a base as a substance whose aqueous solution gives, respectively, a higher concentration of hydrogen ion or of hydroxide ion than that furnished by pure water. This is a very one sided definition."
Dan Lipinski,"The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use."
Erno Rubik,"I was searching for a way to demonstrate 3D movement to my students and one day found myself staring into the River Danube, looking at how the water moved around the pebbles. This became the inspiration for the cube's twisting mechanism. The fact that it can do this without falling apart is part of its magic."
Miguel de Cervantes,"Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water."
Hilary Swank,"To me, working out is literally like eating a meal or drinking water or breathing."

Brendan I. Koerner,"Sea-Monkeys are hybrid brine shrimp and the brainchild of the mail-order entrepreneur Harold von Braunhut in 1957. When their crystallized eggs are submerged in water, minuscule crustaceans emerge; they can grow up to 2 inches long."
Jesse Ventura,"When you drink fluoridated water, you're drinking liquid Prozac. You drink enough of it, even though it's a small amount, drink it for decades and decades and what does Prozac do to you? It dumbs you down; it makes you docile."
Josh Fox,"The problem is that everywhere the gas drilling industry goes, a trail of water contamination, air pollution, health concerns and betrayal of basic American civic and community values follows."
Ken Wilber,"The Enlightenment was an attempt to liberate myth and base truth claims on evidence, not just dogma. But when science threw out the church, they threw out the baby with the bath water."
Antonio Guterres,"A refugee in the traditional vision is someone who flees from country to another because of persecution or conflict. But what we're witnessing now more and more is a certain number of mega-trends interacting with one another: population growth, urbanization, food insecurity, water scarcity, climate change, and conflict."
Kevin Richardson,"We can have technology, prosperity, nice homes and cars, but at the same time we must be conscious of what we are dumping into the water, the air and our food."
Clive Cussler,"When I first started writing, I was in advertising at the time, I was doing most of my writing on weekends. I had studied most of the other series heroes and I figured it would be fun for mine to be different and put him in and around water. So I dreamed up Dirk Pitt."
S. Jay Olshansky,"We have grown accustomed to the wonders of clean water, indoor plumbing, laser surgery, genetic engineering, artificial joints, replacement body parts, and the much longer lives that accompany them. Yet we should remember that the vast majority of humans ever born died before the age of 10 from an infectious disease."
Will Ferrell,"I left 'Saturday Night Live' without a film to go to, and I'd filmed 'Old School' while I was in my last season of the show, and that hadn't come out yet. I was a free agent, in a way, but I knew it was time to leave the show and test the water."
Liam Neeson,I came to water late. I learned to swim at the age of 20.

Max Heindel,"In all religions, the quickening spirit has been symbolically represented as a bird. At the baptism, when Jesus' body was in the water, the Spirit of Christ descended into it as a dove."
William Kamkwamba,"Clean water and power is our right as humans on this earth, and for too long, our governments in Africa have failed to provide these things."
Evonne Goolagong Cawley,I love to fish. I love the peacefulness of being around the water.
Wil S. Hylton,"The park lies directly downwind from a slew of coal plants. Virtually all of the major contaminants in the local air and water are direct results of coal emissions. Coal produces ozone, which kills trees. Coal produces sulfates, which kill fish. No other park in the country has more ozone or sulfates than Shenandoah National Park."
Tomas Transtromer,"A ship's engine far away on the water expands the summer-night horizon. Both joy and sorrow swell in the dew's magnifying glass. Without really knowing, we divine; our life has a sister ship, following quietly another route. While the sun blazes behind the islands."
Jim Costa,"Additionally, Smart Irrigation Month serves to recognize advances in irrigation technology and practices that produce not only more but also higher quality plants with less water."
Corey Feldman,"It was a great experience for a kid, because it was a bunch of kids playing on pirate ships and water slides, so looking back on it, it was the fondest experience of my childhood."
Valentina Zelyaeva,"Diseases happen in acidic environments, so it's very important to keep your body alkaline. Keeping a diet high in leafy greens, spring water, fresh air, raw almonds, lemons, grapefruits, and warm water with juice from half a lemon helps lower acidity levels."
Alice Walker,"War contributes greatly to global warming, which shouldn't surprise us. All those bombs going off, all those rockets, all those planes and helicopters. All that fuel of various kinds being used. It pollutes the air and water of this very fragile and interconnected planet."
Bruce Forsyth,"I do lead a careful diet, I don't overeat, I have fruit and vegetables every day and I drink a lot of water. And my darling wife keeps me so young it is ridiculous. Being with her is an inspiration as well."
Eavan Boland,"I know now that I began writing in a country where the word 'woman' and the word 'poet' were almost magnetically opposed. One word was used to invoke collective nurture, the other to sketch out self-reflective individualism. Both states were necessary - that much the culture conceded - but they were oil and water and could not be mixed."
Roy Cooper,"When it comes to drinking water, there is no room for political posturing or hollow solutions."

Dogen,The color of the mountains is Buddha's body; the sound of running water is his great speech.
Wallace Stevens,"Most people read poetry listening for echoes because the echoes are familiar to them. They wade through it the way a boy wades through water, feeling with his toes for the bottom: The echoes are the bottom."
Ethan Canin,"In the winter, I read next to a wood-burning stove. In the summer, we have a place up in Michigan where I like to read in a hammock. It's almost entirely hidden by cedar trees and right up by the water. You can climb in there and see nothing but water and be seen by nobody. It's perfect."
William Kamkwamba,I want to bring clean water to people who do not have it. What I'm trying to do now is think of ways to build a well-drilling machine that is low-cost so people in rural areas can afford it.
Morena Baccarin,"I swim laps, which is nice because I'm weightless in the water."
Nicholas Kristof,"Most of the villagers were hiding in the bush, where they were dying from bad water, malaria and malnutrition."
Bella Thorne,My secret is one the world needs to know - nearly a billion people a year die from unsafe drinking water.
Nayib Bukele,"People don't flee their homes because they want to, people flee their homes because they feel they have to. Why? Because they don't have a job, because they are being threatened by gangs, because they don't have basic things like water, education, health."
Manoj Bhargava,"People with water-borne diseases occupy more than 50% of hospital beds across the world. Does the answer lie in building more hospitals? Really, what is needed is to give them clean water."
Hayao Miyazaki,I think Tokyo is going to sink under water soon. All those stupid high-rise buildings will sink and maybe all the traffic will be gone. And everything will be peaceful and quiet.
Chief Joseph,For a short time we lived quietly. But this could not last. White men had found gold in the mountains around the land of winding water.
Norman Reedus,"I went camping one time when I was twelve, to the Great Lakes. My friend stepped in really deep muddy water and started screaming and sinking. My mom ran up, and I was just standing there a foot away and wouldn't stick out my hand to pull him up. So I'm probably not the best person to take on a camping trip."
Albert Szent-Gyorgyi,"Investigations during the last few decades have brought hydrogen instead of carbon, and instead of CO2 water, the mother of all life, into the foreground."
Joe Harris,"A lot of Washington state is beautiful. You have just tons of mountains, beautiful bodies of water, you have a lot of rolling hills in eastern Washington. I'm biased, obviously, but there's not a lot of places in the world that are like where I grew up."

Jeremy Wade,"The first time you catch a fish, it's amazing. You make contact with this whole other world that exists, hidden, under the water."
Charles Ray,"As soon as you step into the water, you are part of the food chain; you're part of the wilderness. That's why I like solo sailing. You can be macho, but at least you can be macho on your own."
Jakob Bohme,"Just as a drop of water in the ocean cannot avail much; but if a great river runneth into it, that maketh a great commotion."
Helene D. Gayle,"The more you look into health and health inequalities, you realize that a lot of it is not due to a particular disease - it's really linked to underlying societal issues such as poverty, inequity, lack of access to safe drinking water and housing. And these are all the things we focus on at CARE."
Kim Jong-un,It is a proud tradition and fighting trait of our army and people to rise up like mountains and go through fire and water to unfailingly carry through the party's orders and instructions.
James May,I've never quite trusted water; I don't think it's entirely healthy.
Jack Hanna,"Wild animals are just as confused as people are now. You've got toxins in the water, oil, sewage, all sorts of things."
Robert Englund,"I'm scared by the enormous amount of bottled water being consumed today, instead of people drinking filtered tap water. Did you know that nearly 90 percent of those plastic bottles are not recycled and wind up in landfills where it takes thousands of years for the plastic to decompose?"
Matthew Bourne,"I had daydreamed through many performances of Swan Lake, thinking the dancing tutus only ever conveyed one aspect of swans: their beauty gliding on water. I wondered what it would be like to use male dancers and bring out swans' aggressive, muscular side."
Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"I don't go to the doctor except when I'm very ill, and when I go to India, I drink a drop of local water."
Joy Reid,"In the 1950s, the black men and women and their white allies who fought for civil rights and basic human dignity could look to the federal government. If the racist sheriff and his troops beat them with batons or sprayed them and their children with water cannons, the attorney general would act."
Patti Smith,You can't change the world; you can't fix the whole environment. But you can recycle. You can turn the water off when you're brushing your teeth. You can do small things.
Dan Coats,"A major attack on our cyber systems could shut down our critical infrastructure - financial systems, communications systems, electric grids, power plants, water treatment centers, transportation systems and refineries - that allows us to run our economy and protect the safety of Americans."
Caterina Fake,It's fairly easy to know when you've succeeded because you're kind of hanging on for dear life. It's such an unstoppable juggernaut; you're trying to stay with your head above water because things are moving so fast.
Faith Hill,I drink a lot of water and I never leave the house without putting on moisturizer and lip gloss.
Jackie Shroff,"One must eat fruit and drink water before meals rather than after eating. Water dilutes digestion, and that's not a good thing for the body."
Madelyn Cline,"It's not called the low country for nothing, it's literally at sea level. If we don't start paying attention to conservation in our environment, the water levels are going to rise and those areas are going to start disappearing."
Nina Simone,"I would like a man now who is rich, and who can give me a boat - a sailboat. I want to own it and let him pay for it. My first love is the sea and water, not music. Music is second."
Nicolas Chamfort,Do you think that revolutions are made with rose water?
Aimee Mullins,"The best beauty secret, besides sleep and plenty of water, is do whatever it is - before you go out, before you need to feel beautiful - do whatever makes you feel confident. If it's putting on a great dance record and rocking out in your apartment, do it. If kissing someone for 10 minutes makes you feel confident, do it."
Henry Rollins,"We're at peak oil, peak water, peak resources, and so either we figure it out and let science lead or we head down a very bad, dark trail to where a lot of people aren't going to make it."
Doutzen Kroes,"Drink a lot of water, wear big sunglasses, and don't wear make-up on the flight."

Nicholas Negroponte,"Even in the developing parts of the world, kids take to computers like fish to water."
Pier Luigi Loro Piana,"Sailing is in the same vein as horse riding. There's a beauty to it; it's an elegant sport. You have to employ your intelligence. It's technical, but you also have to take into account the natural elements - the wind, the water, the weather."
Jesse Ventura,I've jumped out of an airplane 34 times. I've dove 212 feet under water. I've done a lot of things that defied death.
Amy Tan,"I did not lose myself all at once. I rubbed out my face over the years washing away my pain, the same way carvings on stone are worn down by water."
Bridget Marquardt,The Yucatan Peninsula is really worth the trip. The water is stunning and the beaches are true-white sand.
P. J. O'Rourke,"The problem in Afghanistan is really not so much land as water. It's a dry country with ample amounts of water running through it, but not to good enough effect."
Juan Antonio Bayona,Everybody has an idea of the tsunami of being a big wave. It is not a big wave. It is a huge amount of water that comes to land.
Rex Hunt,"The outdoors, the beautiful environment, both in fresh and salt water. And the thing that concerns me is the amount of kids that stand on street corners, or go into pinball parlours, and call it recreation."
David Suzuki,"We are over 60 percent water by weight. We're just a big ball of... blob of water, with enough organic thickener added so we don't dribble away on the floor."
Abigail Spanberger,"The results of inequity and bias impact everything from suspension rates, to housing access, to health outcomes, to medical interventions, to job opportunity and promotions, to criminal sentencing, and even to the very safety of the water one drinks and air one breathes."
Ritchie Torres,"I spent almost all my life in poverty, raised by a single mother who had to raise three children on minimum wage, which in the 1990s was $4.25 an hour. And I grew up in public housing, in conditions of mold and mildew, leaks and lead, without reliable heat and hot water in the winter."
Cindy Sheehan,"We're not going to cure terrorism and spread peace and goodwill in the Middle East by killing innocent people, or I'm not even saying our bullets and bombs are killing them. The occupation that they don't have food. They don't have clean water. They don't have electricity. They don't have medicine. They don't have doctors."
Matthew McConaughey,"When I'm surfing, I'm sure not thinking about the paparazzi. I guess if they start getting on floaties and coming out there in the water, then I might be a little upset."
Lowell Thomas,"Separately there was only wind, water, sail, and hull, but at my hand the four had been given purpose and direction."
Will Steger,Within 10 years it will be impossible to travel to the North Pole by dog team. There will be too much open water.
Suzan DelBene,"We must not risk defunding environmental conservation programs, which is why Congress should reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund to preserve our natural resources."
Jim Yong Kim,The water issue is critically related to climate change. People say that carbon is the currency of climate change. Water is the teeth.
Jagmeet Singh,"There's no excuse in 2019, with the wealth we have as a nation, with the technology we have as a country, that we cannot clean this water, ensure that all communities have clean drinking water."
Sachin Tendulkar,"If efforts to do social work are couched in selfish motives, then they will die a premature death. Why would my efforts get politicised? I have values I inherited from my father. He helped many. Anyone, even a postman knocking on our door would get a glass of water and some sweets."
John Densmore,"Yes, the '60s went too far, but we were trying to find new ways, better ways, to do things. And great seeds were planted: civil rights, the peace movement, the environmental movement, feminism. They're big seeds. They take a long time to come to fruition. Please, let's stop fighting, and get out our water cans."
Stephen Curry,"I like that Brita makes tap water taste good, so you don't need to spend money or waste plastic with bottled water."
Michael Moore,"I'm going to guess Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, all want clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. I'm sure most people think women should be paid the same as men if they're doing the same job. I think we all want good schools for our kids. If we made that list, we actually are in agreement on more things."
Charles Duhigg,State and federal studies indicate that thousands of water and sewer systems may be too old to function properly.
Ike Turner,"I'm not gonna try to defend, or undo what's been done. All I could say about whatever's been done, it's been done, and it's water under the bridge. I have no regrets of my life."
Marc Andreessen,"Technology is like water; it wants to find its level. So if you hook up your computer to a billion other computers, it just makes sense that a tremendous share of the resources you want to use - not only text or media but processing power too - will be located remotely."
Alex Padilla,"We cannot sell out our public lands for destructive fossil fuel development that pollutes our air, water, and land."
Ryan Kwanten,I was a terrible loser growing up. I took it far too seriously. There were water works if I lost. I would go home and break it down in angry detail: How did I lose? What could I do next time?
Emmerson Mnangagwa,"You know the trait of a crocodile, don't you? It never hunts outside water. It always goes into the water to catch its prey. It never goes in the villages or in the bush looking for food. It strikes at the appropriate time. So a good guerrilla leader strikes at the appropriate time."
Joe Baca,"With a growing population, there is a growing need for more water delivery and storage."
Brie Larson,"I went through a phase of eating dinner in the shower because I thought, 'Why don't we do that?' Then I realised, 'Because it doesn't make any sense.' It doesn't save any time, and you can't really get into a steak and baked potato when there's water pouring on you."
Erin Brockovich,"I always say I stumbled on the information about the poison in Hinkley's drinking water because I was sort of stumbling about in my life at that time generally, as a single mother."

Brian Skerry,"The Bahamas has mangrove nurseries, coral reefs, shallow sea grass beds, and deep oceanic trenches - all perfect ecosystems for sharks. Photographing multiple shark species in exquisite water was the assignment I had dreamed about from the start."
Nastassja Kinski,"Water is always a support or a healing thing apart from, you know, love or peace of mind."
Jamie Anderson,"I have a glass of alkaline water first thing. I don't have the biggest appetite in the morning, which is kind of tough for me, but I always start with a green drink called Tonic Alchemy. It's a really amazing combination drink that has a lot of different superfoods and algae and Chinese herbs."
Larry Ellison,"One of the great things about Lanai is that the weather is always fabulous. Always 82 degrees and sunny. The problem is that, like California now, Lanai needs more water."

Johnny Weissmuller,"I could make good time because I was so long and skinny, shooting through the water like a stick."
Milos Forman,"I worked with Jack Nitzsche for 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and we'd booked a symphony orchestra. He dismissed them and came with a little man who poured water into glasses of different sizes to make a glass harmonica. And most of the music for the film was that - with some Indian flutes and some drums."
Kate Brown,"Water is the foundation for our economies, communities, ecosystems, and quality of life."
Monica Galetti,I love open water diving and first tried it in Vanuatu.
Sushmita Sen,"I love parasailing, taking strolls, indulging in water sports, hanging out in touristy places - especially night markets."
Jonathan Brandis,"Because the series is situated in the next century, and for the most part under water, there are many innovative technical gadgets. It's a kind of StarTrek. When I first came there, I was really impressed myself."
Nish Kumar,"In the event of a Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic dystopia, people with supplies of food and water could become warlords or chieftains in the social order that emerges out of the rubble."
Selena Gomez,"I always have water, tons of water. It's even in my bathroom because I used to be so bad at drinking water, and I want to stay hydrated."
Patrick Kavanagh,"Life in cities is not a spring but a river, or rather, a water main. It progresses like a novel, artificially."
Tori Kelly,"After I shower and put in all my products, I hang out with the diffuser with my head flipped over for five to seven minutes. But before I use a hair dryer, I'll towel-dry my hair. Actually, drying your hair with an old T-shirt is a great trick. It helps to get all the extra water out, without bringing on frizz."
Ellie Goulding,"I maintain that when I finally retire from my career in music, I will go and live back in Wales - when I am an old person, if I live to be an old person. The water I miss, and the air, there's something different about it. And I miss the simple life."
David A. Bednar,Faithfully obeying God's commandments is essential to receiving the Holy Ghost. We are reminded of this truth each week as we listen to the sacrament prayers and worthily partake of the bread and water.
Clayton M. Christensen,The dumb-manager theory of business problems just didn't hold water for me. There had to be a deeper reason why smart people would make decisions that lead to failure.
Rahul Vaidya,"Height and water are things that mostly everyone is scared of and especially when you are standing on the top of a 50-storey building. Also, I am still scared of water because I don't swim, I have learnt a little here and there but I am not a trained swimmer."
Muhtar Kent,"If there's a choice between tap water and bottled water, the consumer can make that choice. In a very large geography in the world, that choice does not exist."

Aidan Gallagher,You should cut down on your plastic consumption. Go get a reusable water bottle.
Larry Wilcox,"Family is very important to me because that is the footprint we perpetuate. That is, the ripple in the water when the rock first impacts the pool, and it is those waves, that energy that one produces, that determines our direction."
Marc Randolph,"When I first met Jeff Bezos back in the late 90s, the only automated thing in his office was a rotating fan, gently blowing across a pair of identical blue shirts he'd hung on a water pipe behind his desk."
Alton Brown,"A meringue is really nothing but a foam. And what is a foam after all, but a big collection of bubbles? And what's a bubble? It's basically a very flimsy little latticework of proteins draped with water. We add sugar to this structure, which strengthens it. But things can, and do, go wrong."
Charles Duhigg,There is no central government database that allows officials to monitor water tests by local systems.
Ryan Lochte,"My suit blew up into a parachute. All this water rushed in, there's air, water in there. I was freaking out."
Tatiana Schlossberg,"I was really surprised to learn that there is no food date label standardization, which contributes significantly to why we waste so much food, which generates methane emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas, in landfill, and means that we are using lots of land, water, fertilizer and energy to produce food that no one eats."
Matthew Fox,I didn't learn to swim until I was 21 or something because I grew up in the mountains in Wyoming and all the water is glacier runoff and cold.
Greta Gerwig,"Acting was always the first love, but a lot of people want to be actors, and my goal was, 'Come hell or high water, I will be a part of this world, however I can.' So that just led me to throwing myself into every aspect of narrative storytelling I could."

Golshifteh Farahani,"Iranian parents can't stop their children. They're just wild - they want to party, they want their rights, they want to paint, they want to dance. No one can stop these new generations coming. That's why Iran has to open up: it's like a pot full of hot water, vapour and steam."
Karol G,"When I go on trips, I like to have everything in one place. Someone to be in charge of the food, someone to keep things organized, and someone to attend to us. I need the house to be awesome, by the water, with all the amenities I need."
Claire Saffitz,"Pate a choux is a mixture of simple ingredients - flour, water, milk, eggs - but the proper technique is essential. Unlike other doughs, the pastry is pre-cooked on the stovetop before being enriched with eggs, piped, and baked."
Mark Udall,"Ranchers need clean water for their stock, farmers need it for their crops, every employer needs it to stay in business, and every living thing needs it for life... The law needs to be clear to protect water quality and the rights of landowners."
P.K. Subban,"I operate from a place of like water on a duck's back. When things are thrown at me or said to me that aren't worth my time, they don't register with me. Like it just rolls off my back."

Hillary Clinton,I drink tons of water. Just as much water as I can possibly drink.

Lewis Gordon Pugh,"Of all the creatures in the world that really frighten me - the hyena in Africa, the great white shark - leopard seals are near the top of the list. They're killers. If my team spots one, they'll pull me out of the water."
Dave Gibbons,"When I first came to New York City, what I was thrilled about was not the Empire State Building, or the Statue of Liberty; it was the fireplugs in the street. These things that Jack Kirby had drawn. Or these cylindrical water towers on top of buildings that Steve Ditko's 'Spider-Man' fights used to happen in and around."
Charli D'Amelio,"I once saw a TikTok beauty hack about taking a hot bowl of water and using it to steam your face. I tried it, and it feels so good."

Bernard Sumner,"In Salford, we had fish in our tap water. I remember, one hot summer day, running to the toilet at playtime and dunking our heads in a sink full of water. I remember putting my head in and seeing all these little fish in it."
Chris Robinson,"I didn't want to be told what to do. I don't want to water down my music to fit into their formats. I know what rock and roll is to me, but everything's turning into one big commercial."

Daryl Davis,When was 'again?' Was it back when I was drinking from a separate water fountain? Was it when I couldn't eat in that restaurant over there?... 'Make America Great Again' - before I had equality?
Bee Wilson,"Protein bars, protein flapjacks, protein granola, protein ice cream and protein coconut water... To look at the health-food aisles, you'd think that protein was a substance no one could overeat. Even bread now comes in protein-enriched form."
Alisyn Camerota,If it's a beautiful day we love to go to the Museum of Natural History. They have sprinklers. It's what passes for a water park on the Upper West Side.
Kage Baker,"For those of you who thought F. W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu' was his greatest film, I have news for you: his 'Faust' blows it out of the water."
Meryl Streep,"I think we all think we sound really good in the shower, where there's that nice reverb, and the water's drowning you out, and there is some liberation in the freedom of being totally alone and really going for it."
Gunnar Peterson,"Hydration is everything. Think of this: your muscles are 70-plus percent water - how are you not drinking water during a workout? I get the whole, 'Let's challenge ourselves; let's do that prison, tough guy thing,' but at the end of the day, you're underperforming."
Marilyn Ferguson,"Public policy is designed by spin doctors who aim to keep our heads below the water. The public good is not a consideration, and their self-serving agendas prevail over common sense."
Peter Higgs,The model I came up with in 1964 is just the invention of a rather strange sort of medium that looks the same in all directions and produces a kind of refraction that is a little bit more complicated than that of light in glass or water.
George Foreman,My favorite drink is water - the bland one: Evian. I stick with that. I celebrate in the evening sometimes with Perrier. That's why I love coming to California. They're always talking to you about bottled water.
Debbie Stabenow,"As a Michigan senator, I feel a special responsibility to protect the Great Lakes. They are not only a source of clean drinking water for more than 30 million people but are also an integral part of Michigan's heritage and its economy."
Richard Lamm,"Our globe is under new dramatic environmental pressure: our globe is warming, our ice caps melting, our glaciers receding, our coral is dying, our soils are eroding, our water tables falling, our fisheries are being depleted, our remaining rainforests shrinking. Something is very, very wrong with our eco-system."
Kenny Smith,"If you put 100 people on an island with no food, no water, no hope of a ship coming, then some will overcome it and be resourceful, some will live in it, others will panic, and others will show horrific character, which is wrong. But not to understand that all alternatives are possible is wrong as well."
Chris Morocco,"My pantry pastas fall somewhere in the middle of the time spectrum. They're simple, streamlined, and flexible, with unfussy yet massively flavorful sauces that come together in the time it takes to boil water and cook pasta."
Graeme Souness,"There's managers out there now who would love to have won a single trophy. The fact is the vast majority of them haven't. So I'm quite cool about what I did as a player and as a manager. Could I have done better, or differently? Of course. But that's all water that has flowed under the bridge; it doesn't cause me any sleepless nights."
Clarence Thomas,"People get bent out of shape about the fact that when I was a kid, you could not drink out of certain water fountains. Well, the water was the same."
Edith Sitwell,"Hot water is my native element. I was in it as a baby, and I have never seemed to get out of it ever since."
Ramez Naam,"On a large scale, people aren't going to cut back how much they use. That's a pipe dream. If anything, as the developing world gets richer, the world's going to consume more - more cars, bigger homes, more energy, more water, more food."
Lyall Watson,"The limits of sensory evolution in fish are defined very largely by their habitat. Water is physically supportive, carries some kinds of odour well, and is kind to sound - letting it travel several times faster than air will allow, but it inhibits other more personal kinds of communication."
Kenza Fourati,"My skincare routine is pretty minimal. My must-have products are rose water, witch hazel, Embryolisse Creme, and Dr. Colbert's Eye Cream."
David Suzuki,"It's not unexpected that shooting massive amounts of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure into the earth to shatter shale and release natural gas might shake things up. But earthquakes aren't the worst problem with fracking."
Martin Rees,"We do not fully understand the consequences of rising populations and increasing energy consumption on the interwoven fabric of atmosphere, water, land and life."
Marsha Blackburn,"Republicans are for clean water, clean air, and clean energy. We are not for taxing people out of their house, home and business to pay for it. And that is the fundamental difference between the Democrats and Republicans on this issue."
Chrishell Stause,You work on it. You talk about it. You don't go out looking for greener grass; sometimes you have to water the grass that you have. And that's what marriage is. Sometimes it can be hard.
Jil Sander,"One glass of water doesn't equal another. One may just appease the thirst, the other you may enjoy thoroughly. In Japan, people know about this difference."
Stephen Curry,Water is my drink.
Rex Tillerson,"In conventional oil and natural gas production, you always produce a lot of formation water, and it's crummy water. It's real salty. It's got heavy metals in it. It's got bad stuff in it."
Ace Frehley,"When you take a shower in space, you have to press the water onto your body to clean yourself, and then you gotta vacuum it off."
Quentin Tarantino,"It's a standard staple in Japanese cinema to cut somebody's arm off and have red water hoses for veins, spraying blood everywhere."

Devendra Banhart,"I remember when I was a kid I thought I could either be an athletic water drinker, like an Olympic-level water drinker, or I could invent Windex. Which I thought was really smart, because it already existed."
Val McDermid,Walking by water frees your creativity. I don't know how it works - there's something about it that's liberating.
William H. O'Connell,"You can pour holy oil and holy water on a thug until you have emptied buckets of both; but at the end he will be a consecrated thug, but a thug all the same unless interior intentions and a disciplined man are present."
Wilhelm Ostwald,"For, with pure water the inversion of cane sugar scarcely proceeds and subsequently it required very thorough, difficult studies before this effect and its order of magnitude were established."
Radhanath Swami,"Sadly, in the name of progress, we have polluted the air, water, soil and the food we eat."
Guy Standing,"Magna Carta only came into being in 1217, when the wording had been changed and parts of the original were extended in the Charter of the Forests. This complementary charter covered liberties granted to the common man, including rights to the commons, grazing, fishing, water, and firewood, and was perhaps the first ecological charter in history."
Stendhal,The man of genius is he and he alone who finds such joy in his art that he will work at it come hell or high water.

Malcolm Brogdon,"I saw from a very young age the value of clean water in communities in Africa. I made a promise to myself that once I reached a time and place in my career where I could do more, I would."
Alex Shoumatoff,"According to the U.N., more than 2.7 billion people will face severe water shortages by 2025. Many social scientists predict that the next big wars will be over water. Nevertheless, the average American family blissfully consumes 300 gallons a day, when you add in watering the lawn and washing dishes, clothes, and cars."
Lee Byung-hun,"For 'The Rise of Cobra,' I was dieting more and using protein powder to help supplement my meals. For 'Retaliation,' however, I opted for more natural protein. I had a chicken breast and broccoli meal about five times every day. I also drank plenty of water and made sure I got enough rest."
Seth Berkley,"The pathway to a more sustainable future for all children must include access to the basic building blocks of good health, including nutrition, water, and immunizations."
Jennifer Aniston,"I always try to sleep for at least eight hours a night and, of course, water, water, water!"
Douglas Brinkley,"It's Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency. Clean Air and Water Acts. Endangered Species Act. Promoted affirmative action. One could go on and on with Nixon as a New Deal liberal on domestic policy and a hawk, but one with great geo-political skills."
Joe Gibbs,"I can't remember if it was in the third grade in school, I was being told that two amoeba happened to hit in a muddy puddle of water two billion years ago, and I was an accident. I was the result. I wasn't real smart, but I said, 'I don't like the sound of that.'"
"Albert II, Prince of Monaco","My father gave me this poster from National Geographic back in the very early 70s, so I was a young teenager. It showed how man polluted his world. And the issues that they talked about, whether it was water pollution, air, or terrestrial... The issues that they talk about on this poster are still very much present today."
Robert Bilott,"We're talking about a chemical that's out there. Not just on one farm in West Virginia, not even just in the public water of an entire community there, but it's now in water all over the country, all over the planet, in the blood of virtually every living thing."
Erin Brockovich,"When I discovered that hexavalent chromium was causing cancer in the town of Hinkley, California, it led to residents being paid $333m in compensation. But, unbelievably, that chemical remains in our drinking water."

Kevin Garnett,"It's scary when one day the city is there and the next day it's gone. To see the water actual kill people, I couldn't believe it. I never fathomed it could bury a city."
Rebecca MacKinnon,"Most people who use the Internet seem take its nature and characteristics for granted, like we take air and water for granted."
Brittany Snow,"My mom is big on moisturizer and water. She always reminds me to drink a lot of water and wear sunglasses because I always forget them when I go out, even though they are one of my favorite accessories. She always reminds me about wrinkles, and always did, so it's kind of been ingrained into me."
Ronnie Dunn,"When I get all focused on songwriting, I get into all the marketing and promotion that we do to make it happen. Then the right song comes along and blows it all out of the water. The right song will do it for you every time."
Will Forte,"It's good to please the network, but you really just have to tell the stories you want to tell, and if you try to please other people, it ends up starting to water stuff down. Those decisions we have to make are hard, but we usually just err on the side of 'What would we want to see?'"

Doris Lessing,"If a fish is the movement of water embodied, given shape, then cat is a diagram and pattern of subtle air."
Jewel,"It's like a garden: Whatever you water the most will do the best. At some point, you decide whether you'll water your career or your relationship more."
Mario J. Molina,"In contrast to the troposphere, the stratosphere is extremely dry and practically cloudless - the concentration of water vapor is measured in parts per million and is, in fact, comparable to that of ozone."
Ross Douthat,"To visit the West Coast, now and always, is to be overwhelmed by its beauty - the blue water and blue skies, the temperate air and the beaches and the looming mountains not so far away."
Donna Tartt,"When I'm writing, I am concentrating almost wholly on concrete detail: the color a room is painted, the way a drop of water rolls off a wet leaf after a rain."
James Stockdale,There was nothing there but black water and American fire power.
Peter O'Toole,"Irish women are always carrying water on their heads, and always carrying their husbands home from pubs. Such things are the greatest posture-builders in the world."
Eden Robinson,"In a pine tree behind me, an eagle waits out the rain, hunched into himself, brooding. Crows squabble, a murder chasing a raven. Seals cruise the lines of fishing nets bobbing in the water, hoping for an easy meal, the tender bellies of salmon."
Suzanne Somers,"If you can't afford organic food and are unable to grow your own, it's crucial to wash all inorganic produce very carefully to minimize the toxins you consume. Soak everything for 20 minutes in water with vinegar and salt or water with fresh lemon juice and salt."
Frans Lanting,"Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force. And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars."
Carol Ann Duffy,"If we think of what's up ahead, with climate change and wars over water, it's very frightening."

Angela Bassett,Drink a bunch of water and get facials regularly. I take care of my skin.
Malcolm Turnbull,"Climate change is a global problem. The planet is warming because of the growing level of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.

Johnny Van Zant,I saw B.B. King in concert one time where he had this guy that would bring him out a glass of water and towel to wipe his forehead with.
Bunker Roy,"Who is a professional? A professional is someone who has a combination of competence, confidence and belief. A water diviner is a professional. A traditional midwife is a professional. A traditional bone setter is a professional. These are professionals all over the world. You find them in any inaccessible village around the world."
Richard Dean Anderson,"I've been working with them for a couple years and a couple of projects. Essentially Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is the chief litigator for this corporation, this Alliance, and their job is to prosecute corporate polluters of the great bodies of water in North America."
Sonny Rollins,It's all about creation and surprise. It just needs to be appreciated and watered like flowers. You have to water flowers. These peaks will come again.
George Ripley,"This is our mercury, our lunary, but whosoever thinks of any other water besides this, is ignorant and foolish, never attaining to the desired effects."

Paul Gosar,Do you understand about water in the West? Whiskey's for drinking; water's for fightin' over.
Maxime Bernier,"We want First Nations and these people to be like Canadians on a lot of points of view. Right now, that's not normal that they cannot have running water on reserve. We need to fix that, but it must not be imposed by Ottawa, a top-down bureaucratic decision."
Paul Hawken,"Commercial institutions, proud of their achievements, do not see that healthy living systems - clean air and water, healthy soil, stable climates - are integral to a functioning economy.

Mike Farrell,People seem to see no difference between an intimate conversation and a conversation at the water cooler.

Lisa Kennedy Montgomery,Sleep and hydration are the very best things you can do for your skin. You want to drink water and green tea throughout the day and get as much sleep as you possible can.
Steven Gundry,"Nothing is worse than washing a head of lettuce or greens, then trying to blot the water with paper towels. A salad spinner lets you rinse, then spin all the water off completely. Plus, it's fun to use."
Sunil Grover,"If you can drink water when you want, you are lucky, if you can sit up on your bed by yourself, you are lucky, if you can walk to the bathroom without anyone's help, you are lucky."
Flea,"Water is my main state. If I time before I run - like, to digest, like, a good hour and a half or so to digest, I'll eat oatmeal. but I'm a vegetarian for the most part, so in general, I just eat grains and vegetables and fruit."
Mike Espy,"I am a lifelong Mississippian. I remember Jim Crow, 'colored' and 'white' water fountains, and my mother's inability to try on a dress in a store because no white woman would buy it if she put it back."
Diana Nyad,"In swimming, especially training out in the ocean and open water, you got fogged-over goggles, you're stuck with your own thoughts - there's great benefits to that, deep thinking like that after many hours, but there's also tremendous loneliness. You burn out. You want to run, jump, ski, do anything. So at age 30, I was finished."
Thomas Babington Macaulay,Many politicians are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom. The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim.

Phillip Noyce,"Oh yeah - I watched Knife in the Water, saw the shot, and repeated it. But even if I hadn't seen that film, inevitably the camera would've ended up on top of that mast, I mean if you think of it there are only so many dynamic shots on a boat."

Sylvester Stallone,"When you're on top and you lead the parade, everyone's there throwing lilies and lilac water on your head. But when those parades have gone by and there's a storm in your heart, there are very few people that are going to sit there and listen to you bemoan life."

Jason Segel,"I've just grown a little disappointed with 'Muppets in the Old West', 'Muppets Under Water' and all these weird concept movies. I just want to go take it back to the early 80's, when it was about the Muppets trying to put on a show. That's what I'm trying to bring back."

Breckin Meyer,"I once threw a water balloon on a girl because I caught her cheating on me. She was kissing my friend and I thought, 'Oh, this can't be happening.' It was bad and I was much older than you think throwing a water balloon. I was 14."
Brooke Burns,"I swim all the time at night - I've always been a water girl. It's a black-bottom pool and my pool light was out, and as I've done a thousand times I just kind of did a little seal dive. I saw a huge bright light and I literally thought, 'That's it.'"
Timothy Olyphant,"Sharks will scare me. I went out to Malibu a couple of weeks ago. Beautiful, clear day, out in five feet of water, going to surf, and there was this big ol' freakin' leopard shark... I'm looking at him and I'm thinking, 'OK, he won't hurt me.'"
Stephanie Rice,"I think for me I've always loved being in the water and I love training and I love being at the pool so you know it's not a chore for me to go training, but come race day I would never just train to train - I train to race."

Gabrielle Union,I drink a gallon of water a day.

Darrell Issa,Some people say that watching pay freezes in the government is like watching water freeze. It expands.
Scott Weiland,"When people ask me if I have a hobby, a lot of times my answer is that I like to surf in warm water. I like to ski, if I have the opportunity. But really, I like to go to my studio and write music that I want to write, where there's no pressure to come up with a hit single."
Steve Blake,"My oldest son always wants to race. He's kind of like me and it now has carried over to the other two. They're all pretty competitive now. We do stuff in the pool.
